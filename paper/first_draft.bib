	abstract="A Monte-Carlo evaluation consists in estimating a position by averaging the outcome of several random continuations. The method can serve as an evaluation function at the leaves of a min-max tree. This paper presents a new framework to combine tree search with Monte-Carlo evaluation, that does not separate between a min-max phase and a Monte-Carlo phase. Instead of backing-up the min-max value close to the root, and the average value at some depth, a more general backup operator is defined that progressively changes from averaging to min-max as the number of simulations grows. This approach provides a fine-grained control of the tree growth, at the level of individual simulations, and allows efficient selectivity. The resulting algorithm was implemented in a 9{\texttimes}9 Go-playing program, Crazy Stone, that won the 10th KGS computer-Go tournament.",

	abstract = {We consider a non-Bayesian infinite horizon version of the multi-armed bandit problem with the objective of designing simple policies whose regret increases slowly with time. In their seminal work on this problem, Lai and Robbins had obtained a O(log n) lower bound on the regret with a constant that depends on the Kullback-Leibler number. They also constructed policies for some specific families of probability distributions (including exponential families) that achieved the lower bound. In this paper we construct index policies that depend on the rewards from each arm only through their sample mean. These policies are computationally much simpler and are also applicable much more generally. They achieve a O(log n) regret with a constant that is also based on the Kullback-Leibler number. This constant turns out to be optimal for one-parameter exponential families; however, in general it is derived from the optimal one via a 'contraction' principle. Our results rely entirely on a few key lemmas from the theory of large deviations.},
