<h1>Instructions</h1>
<div>
  This is a game where you are trying to get as many points as possible, by <b>selecting vertical bars with the greatest combined height</b>.
  <p>At the beginning of the game, the height of each bar is hidden.
  <br>Once you select a bar, its height will be revealed.
  <br>You select a bar by clicking on it twice. The first time you click, it will be outlined in red.
  <br>Click again to submit your selection. You will earn points equal to its height, added to your total score.
  <br><b>You can select the same bar multiple times</b>

  <p>You will have {{trials}} chances to select bars and increase your score.</p>

  <h2>Example</h2>
  
  <p>The picture below shows an example with three bars.
  <p>The player first selected the middle bar, and got 100 points.
  <br>Next, the player selected the right bar, and got another 200 points.
  Your score is based <b>on the all of the bars you select.</b>
