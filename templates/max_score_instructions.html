This is a game where you are trying to get as many points as possible, by selecting different vertical bars. At the beginning of the game, the value associated with each bar is hidden, but once you select a bar it will be revealed, with the height of the black part of the bar indicating its values.
</div>
<br>
<div>
You select a bar by clicking on it twice. The first time you click, it will be outlined in red; the second click means you have selected it, so its value is revealed and added to your total score. You will have {{trials}} chances to select bars and increase your score.
